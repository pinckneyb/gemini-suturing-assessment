Good job overall. Could improve efficiency with more practice. Some reposition of suture/needle and a bit of inconsistency of the tension of thesutures, but overall good technique.

Very nice demonstration. Only suggestion is perhaps to tighten knots down slightly more on some of the sutures, but really a very gooddemonstration.

9. Other Summative Comments 
Good job overall. Would recommend tying your knots with tension in a direction that is perpendicular to the incision/wound. Also, would emphasizeeven more strongly entering the skin at a 90 degree angle to evert the skin edges more.

Good job. First stitch could have been a bit tighter, but the next few were much better as you got going. With time economy of motion will continue toimprove.

9. Other Summative Comments 
Occasionally not laing first throw down square. Also don't be afraid to take in two bites if that helps get a more consistently square thrown on secondside, but overall looked good and fluent.

9. Other Summative Comments 
Would leave tails a little longer to make easier to grasp when instrument tying, and can use forceps more than you did--didn't use at all on somethrows, and you will need to use in real tissue most of the time. Overall a well demonstrated performance.

9. Other Summative Comments 
Good job overall. Good eversion of skin edges. Always try to take similarly sized bites on each side of the incision. One or two sutures had unequalbites, but the rest looked great.

9. Other Summative Comments 
Good job overall. With increased experience economy of motion will continue to improve. Focus on entering the skin perpendicularly to the surface andexiting perpendicularly. I really try to overemphasize that as this will really ever the skin edges nicely on a real patient.

9. Other Summative Comments 
Good job with simple interrupted suturing. Would recommend entering the skin at a more perpendicular angle. This is something to really focus on asthis maneuver is what really everts the skin edges and makes for a nicely healing scar for long term outcomes following contracture. Try to push theknot down perpendicular to the incision as well.

Overall good job. Be careful when laying down the knots. They could be a bit more square. Would recommend always laying the knot down by pullingperpendicular to the wound in opposing directions with each throw.
