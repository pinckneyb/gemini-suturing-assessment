# RESTORATION SUMMARY - July 15, 2025

## Problem Solved
- **Issue**: Assessment output had regressed to verbose video descriptions instead of structured VoP rubric format
- **Root Cause**: Changes to API structure and prompts that broke the working format
- **Solution**: Restored working version from GitHub repository

## What Was Restored

### 1. API Structure
- **From**: `google.generativeai` SDK with `GenerativeModel`
- **To**: `google.genai` with `types.Content` and `types.Part`
- **Impact**: This was the primary cause of the regression

### 2. Prompts
- **Working Format**: Clear, specific instructions without aggressive language
- **Key Phrase**: "Do not add any extra labels or commentary"
- **Consistency**: Video and still image prompts are identical

### 3. Output Processing
- **Removed**: Timeout handling and line stripping that interfered with output
- **Restored**: Simple, clean output assembly

## Major Improvement Added

### 4. Hybrid Summative Comment Generation
- **Problem**: Summative comments were generated independently via separate API call, often contradicting individual rubric scores
- **Initial Solution**: Generate summative comment programmatically based on actual rubric scores
- **Improved Solution**: Hybrid approach combining programmatic analysis with Gemini's natural language generation
- **Streamlined Format**: Individual rubric points now have brief justifications, with detailed analysis moved to summative comment
- **Stringent Grading Curve**: 4s and 5s are now as rare as 1s and 2s, with 3/5 as the true default for competent performance
- **Benefits**:
  - Ensures consistency between individual scores and final comment
  - Eliminates mechanical repetition of scores
  - Provides natural, flowing narrative text
  - Maintains concrete, actionable feedback
  - Uses professional medical terminology
  - Includes fallback mechanism for reliability
  - Reduces redundancy and improves readability
  - More realistic and stringent grading distribution for surgical training

## Files Restored
- `gemini_assessor.py`: Updated with programmatic summative comment generation
- `suturing_assessment_app.py`: 32KB, 669 lines (from GitHub)

## Prevention Measures Implemented

### 1. Documentation Lock
- `WORKING_PROMPTS_BACKUP.md`: Complete backup of working prompts and API structure
- Contains exact code snippets and "DO NOT MODIFY" warnings
- Updated to reflect programmatic summative comment generation

### 2. Validation Script
- `test_assessment_format.py`: Automated format validation
- Checks for correct rubric format, final score, and absence of verbose descriptions
- Run after any changes to ensure format is maintained

### 3. Testing Checklist
- 7 rubric points in 3-line format with brief justifications
- Correct final score calculation
- Natural narrative summative comment (not mechanical repetition)
- No verbose descriptions or JSON output
- No duplicate headers
- Summative comment aligns with individual rubric scores
- Summative comment provides detailed analysis and actionable advice
- Individual justifications are concise and focused

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **API Changes Matter**: Switching from `google.genai` to `google.generativeai` caused different behavior
2. **Prompt Consistency**: Video and still prompts must be identical
3. **Minimal Processing**: Post-processing can interfere with output format
4. **Version Control**: GitHub backup saved the day
5. **Independent Generation**: Separate API calls for summative comments can create inconsistencies
6. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining programmatic analysis with AI generation provides best results

## Future Changes

**BEFORE making any changes:**
1. Run `python test_assessment_format.py` to establish baseline
2. Make minimal, targeted changes
3. Test with actual video assessment
4. Run validation script again
5. If format breaks, revert immediately

**NEVER change:**
- API structure (use `google.genai`, not `google.generativeai`)
- Prompt format (keep identical for video and still)
- Output assembly (no post-processing)
- Summative comment generation (use hybrid approach, not separate independent API call)

## Status: âœ… RESTORED AND IMPROVED

The application now produces structured, professional VoP assessment output with consistent summative comments that align with individual rubric scores. All critical components are documented and protected against future regressions.
