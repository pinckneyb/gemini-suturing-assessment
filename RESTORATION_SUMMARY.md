# RESTORATION SUMMARY - July 15, 2025

## Problem Solved
- **Issue**: Assessment output had regressed to verbose video descriptions instead of structured VoP rubric format
- **Root Cause**: Changes to API structure and prompts that broke the working format
- **Solution**: Restored working version from GitHub repository

## What Was Restored

### 1. API Structure
- **From**: `google.generativeai` SDK with `GenerativeModel`
- **To**: `google.genai` with `types.Content` and `types.Part`
- **Impact**: This was the primary cause of the regression

### 2. Prompts
- **Working Format**: Clear, specific instructions without aggressive language
- **Key Phrase**: "Do not add any extra labels or commentary"
- **Consistency**: Video and still image prompts are identical

### 3. Output Processing
- **Removed**: Timeout handling and line stripping that interfered with output
- **Restored**: Simple, clean output assembly

## Files Restored
- `gemini_assessor.py`: 12KB, 259 lines (from GitHub)
- `suturing_assessment_app.py`: 32KB, 669 lines (from GitHub)

## Prevention Measures Implemented

### 1. Documentation Lock
- `WORKING_PROMPTS_BACKUP.md`: Complete backup of working prompts and API structure
- Contains exact code snippets and "DO NOT MODIFY" warnings

### 2. Validation Script
- `test_assessment_format.py`: Automated format validation
- Checks for correct rubric format, final score, and absence of verbose descriptions
- Run after any changes to ensure format is maintained

### 3. Testing Checklist
- 7 rubric points in 3-line format
- Correct final score calculation
- Single paragraph summative comment
- No verbose descriptions or JSON output
- No duplicate headers

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **API Changes Matter**: Switching from `google.genai` to `google.generativeai` caused different behavior
2. **Prompt Consistency**: Video and still prompts must be identical
3. **Minimal Processing**: Post-processing can interfere with output format
4. **Version Control**: GitHub backup saved the day

## Future Changes

**BEFORE making any changes:**
1. Run `python test_assessment_format.py` to establish baseline
2. Make minimal, targeted changes
3. Test with actual video assessment
4. Run validation script again
5. If format breaks, revert immediately

**NEVER change:**
- API structure (use `google.genai`, not `google.generativeai`)
- Prompt format (keep identical for video and still)
- Output assembly (no post-processing)

## Status: âœ… RESTORED AND LOCKED DOWN

The application is now back to producing structured, professional VoP assessment output as it did yesterday. All critical components are documented and protected against future regressions.
