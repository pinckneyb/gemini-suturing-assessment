      "coaptation": {
        "status": "Poor",
        "findings": "Epidermal edges are not flush. Significant puckering, overlapping, and bunching are present along the entire visible length of the closure, creating an uneven surface with both gaps and raised sections."

      "eversion": {
        "status": "Irregular and Excessive",
        "findings": "The closure does not exhibit a minimal, even ridge. Instead, it presents as a series of pronounced, irregular puckers and depressions, indicating inconsistent and excessive tissue eversion and inversion."

      "perfusion": {
        "status": "Not Assessable",

      "bitePlacement": {
        "status": "Indeterminate",
        "findings": "Direct measurement of bite depth and width is not possible from the external view. However, the significant tissue distortion suggests bites may be of inconsistent depth, width, or both."

      "stepLength": {
        "status": "Irregular",
        "findings": "The non-uniform bunching of tissue indicates inconsistent advance per pass (step length), contributing to the puckered appearance rather than a smooth closure."

      "suturePath": {
        "status": "Not Visible",
        "findings": "The internal horizontal path of the suture is not visible. No suture material crosses the epidermis externally, which is consistent with the subcuticular technique."
