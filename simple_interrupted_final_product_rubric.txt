Below is a field-standard “mental picture” of how a well-executed simple interrupted closure should look once every stitch is tied and trimmed.

Edge relationship
Coapted, not overlapped or gapped. The epidermal surfaces meet cleanly with no step-offs; you should not be able to see the dermis between bites. 

Slight eversion. Each loop everts the wound margins just enough that, when swelling subsides, the scar settles flat rather than depressed. 

No blanching. Tissue color remains normal—white edges signal over-tightening and compromised perfusion.

Stitch geometry
Perpendicular entry/exit. The visible limbs of each stitch cross the incision at 90 °, creating clean, vertical “railroad tracks.” 

Equal bite depth and width. Distance from the skin edge to needle entry equals depth through the dermis on both sides, producing mirror-image arcs. 

Regular spacing. Loops sit 5–10 mm apart (variations by anatomic site) and 3–5 mm from the wound edge, giving a uniform ladder­-like rhythm along the closure. 

Loops form shallow arcs. No steep “tent poles”; the suture hugs the skin, minimizing dead space.

Knot characteristics
Flat square (or surgeon’s) knots. Each lie flush on one side of the incision, not directly over it, so they don’t mark the scar or wick contamination. 

Tails trimmed to 3–4 mm (non-absorbable) or 1–2 mm (absorbable intradermal) and oriented parallel to the incision so they don’t catch on dressings.

Global impression
The line resembles a neat zipper: parallel vertical tracks linked by tiny knots on one side, edges everting slightly, no puckers or dog-ears, and uninterrupted skin color.

If you gently tug any single thread, only that stitch moves—confirming true interruption and allowing safe removal of one suture without compromising the rest. 

Overall, the closure looks precise yet “relaxed,” conveying adequate approximation with preserved vascularity—a cosmetic end-point suitable for teaching demonstrations.
