Below is the end-state “snapshot” of a properly tied vertical mattress suture—the classic far-far / near-near closure that combines deep tension relief with crisp epidermal edge eversion.

Edge relationship
Pronounced eversion (“peaks”). The near-near portion gently lifts the wound margins into a low ridge; once swelling recedes, the scar flattens instead of depressing.

No edge overlap or gap. The epidermis meets exactly edge-to-edge; you shouldn’t see a shelf or valley.

Normal perfusion. Color stays pink; blanching or a “bow-string” look indicates you cinched too tight.

Stitch geometry
Component		Placement (adult skin)								Purpose				Visual cue
Far bite (first pass)	6–10 mm from edge, travels deep across wound, exits symmetrically opposite	Off-loads tension from margins	Slightly oblique external segment crossing the incision
Near bite (second pass)	1–2 mm from edge, shallow through dermis, exits 1–2 mm opposite	Precise edge approximation & eversion	Short, low arc lying close to skin surface

Vertical orientation. Both visible limbs cross the incision at ~90 °, forming paired “goalposts” rather than a slanted “X.”

Even spacing. Each mattress unit sits ~8–12 mm from its neighbors; far-to-far distances and near-to-near distances match down the line.

External loops lifted. The bridge of suture between far bites should arch a few millimeters above the skin, not dig in.

Knot characteristics
Square (or surgeon’s) knot, buried laterally. Tie on the far-side of the incision so the knot and tails don’t ride on the healing line.

Tails 3–4 mm long and pointed away from the wound. Prevents wick effect and snagging.

Tension just snug. Knot seats the near-near layer without strangling tissue; far loop still visibly slack enough to slide a probe underneath.

Global impression
The closure resembles a row of tiny tents: elevated wound edges, vertical suture posts, lateral knots, and shallow arches of far-bite suture.

Each mattress can be removed independently without disturbing adjacent stitches, and gentle palpation shows robust edge apposition with minimal lateral tension.

Overall look is deliberate and orderly—ideal for high-tension areas (joints, backs) where eversion and strength trump absolute cosmesis.

This is the reference appearance surgeons use when teaching or grading vertical mattress technique: even geometry, clear eversion, intact perfusion, and knots off the midline.
